# codex-proxy — Agent Guide

## Purpose

`codex-proxy` is a Rust daemon and CLI that authenticates a single user with
ChatGPT OAuth, generates a local fake API key, and exposes an OpenAI-compatible
HTTP endpoint. Coding tools point at this proxy instead of the real OpenAI
platform and get requests transparently forwarded to the ChatGPT Codex backend.

The intended product shape:

1. User runs `codex-proxy auth` once — OAuth PKCE flow, tokens persisted.
2. User runs `codex-proxy start` — proxy daemon listens on `127.0.0.1:8317`.
3. Coding tool configured with `base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8317` and the proxy
   API key printed by `codex-proxy auth`.

## Runtime Contract

These files are written and read across daemon restarts. **Do not change their
paths or schema without a deliberate migration.**

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `./config.toml` | Runtime configuration (TOML). Auto-created on first start. |
| `./data/state.json` | Fake API key + pending OAuth flow state. |
| `./data/tokens.json` | OAuth access token, refresh token, expiry. |

Inside Docker (`WORKDIR /app`) the same relative paths resolve to
`/app/config.toml`, `/app/data/state.json`, `/app/data/tokens.json`.

---

## Key Concepts

### Fake API Key
Generated once via `openssl rand -hex 24`, prefixed `sk-codex-proxy-`, stored
in `state.json`. Clients send this key as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or
`x-api-key: <key>`. The proxy validates it before forwarding any request.

### Token Lifecycle
Tokens are classified as `Missing | Valid | Expiring | Expired` using
`TOKEN_REFRESH_WINDOW_SECONDS = 300`. On daemon startup and on every forwarding
request the proxy checks this status and attempts a refresh when the token is
expiring or expired. Refreshed tokens are persisted to `tokens.json` and
updated in the in-memory `Arc<RwLock<Option<TokenStore>>>`.

### Request Normalization (`prepare_request_body`)
Every responses request forwarded upstream is normalized before forwarding:
- Model name canonicalized via `ModelsConfig::canonicalize` (alias map + fallback).
- `store: false` forced (backend must not cache).
- `stream: true` forced (proxy always streams from backend).
- `item_reference` items removed from the `input` array.
- `id` fields stripped from all remaining `input` items.
- Orphaned `function_call_output` items (whose pair was removed) dropped.
- `reasoning.encrypted_content` added to the `include` array if missing.

### Chat Completions Adapter
`POST /v1/chat/completions` is translated into the responses format by
`translate_chat_completions_request`, forwarded via the same normalization
pipeline, then the response is converted back by `responses_to_chat_completion`.
Function tools and forced function choices are flattened to the Responses schema;
Chat schemas remain non-strict unless explicitly enabled. Streaming is not yet
supported on this route.

An optional `[models.reasoning_efforts]` map binds requested aliases to a required
reasoning effort. Conflicting client efforts fail closed; canonical model requests
retain their existing defaults. Compaction rejects profiled aliases because it
cannot enforce reasoning effort.

### WebSocket Transport
`GET /v1/responses` upgrades to a WebSocket for Codex-style clients. Incoming
`response.create` / `response.append` messages are converted back into the same
responses request pipeline used by `POST /v1/responses`, and upstream SSE
`data:` lines are forwarded to the client as WebSocket text frames.

### SSE Handling
The upstream always returns an SSE stream. For streaming HTTP clients the proxy
adds periodic `: keep-alive` comments and injects an `event: error` frame if
the upstream stream fails mid-flight. For non-streaming HTTP clients the proxy
sends leading JSON whitespace keep-alives while waiting, then
`parse_sse_final_response` scans for a `response.done` or
`response.completed` event and returns its `response` field as JSON.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Auth required | Notes |
|--------|------|---------------|-------|
| GET | `/healthz` | No | Rich JSON status (token_status, forwarding_ready, …) |
| GET | `/readyz` | No | 200 = forwarding ready, 503 = not ready |
| GET | `/v1/models` | Yes | Lists `config.models.advertised` |
| GET | `/v1/models/{model_id}` | Yes | 404 if model not in advertised list |
| GET | `/v1/responses` | Yes | WebSocket compatibility transport |
| POST | `/v1/responses` | Yes | Primary forwarding route |
| POST | `/v1/responses/compact` | Yes | Compact response forwarding route |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | Yes | Non-streaming compat adapter |

## Configuration Reference

All sections have sensible defaults and auto-serialize to `config.toml` on
first run. See `config.example.toml` for an annotated reference.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `server.bind` | `127.0.0.1` | Proxy listen host |
| `server.port` | `8317` | Proxy listen port |
| `server.log_filter` | `info` | tracing filter (same as RUST_LOG) |
| `auth.callback_bind_host` | `127.0.0.1` | OAuth callback listener bind host for local runs |
| `auth.redirect_host` | `localhost` | Host embedded in the OAuth redirect URI |
| `auth.callback_port` | `1455` | OAuth callback listener port |
| `auth.open_browser` | `true` | Auto-open browser during auth |
| `auth.timeout_seconds` | `300` | Seconds to wait for OAuth callback |
| `upstream.responses_base_url` | `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api` | ChatGPT backend |
| `upstream.codex_responses_path` | `/codex/responses` | Codex endpoint path |
| `upstream.codex_compact_path` | `/codex/responses/compact` | Codex compact endpoint path |
| `upstream.keep_alive_interval_secs` | `15` | HTTP keep-alive heartbeat interval; `0` disables it |
| `models.advertised` | `["gpt-5.4", "gpt-5.4-mini", "gpt-5.3-codex"]` | Models returned by /v1/models |
| `models.fallback` | `gpt-5.4` | Model used when no alias matches |
| `models.aliases` | see config.example.toml | Provider-prefixed → canonical name map |

## Working Rules

- Keep the path contract stable unless a migration is part of the task.
- Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `config.example.toml` together when
  changing runtime behaviour or architecture.
- Prefer small, testable diffs over broad rewrites.
- Add or update tests when adding normalization logic or changing the request
  pipeline — the fixture files in `tests/fixtures/` are the canonical input/output
  contract for `prepare_request_body`.

## Validation Baseline

Before closing meaningful changes, run:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo check
cargo test
```

When Docker or packaging changes are involved, also run:

```bash
docker build -t codex-proxy:latest .
./scripts/release-check.sh
```

For Docker auth changes, verify the image-level config too:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat codex-proxy:latest /app/config.toml
```

## Personal fork security changes

This fork keeps upstream's runtime paths and JSON schemas. It replaces state files
atomically with owner-only permissions and fsync, serializes refresh-token use,
rejects unknown models instead of silently using `models.fallback` (the legacy
field remains accepted), removes permissive browser CORS, and omits upstream
headers and response bodies from diagnostics. Keep the API and temporary OAuth
callback on loopback. Bifrost supplies authenticated access and concurrency limits.
The chat adapter translates function tools; use `/v1/responses` for streaming.

For a remote server, OAuth needs no public route, DNS name, TLS certificate, or
inbound firewall rule. Use a temporary SSH localhost tunnel or the paste fallback.
Stop the daemon before `auth` and restart it afterward to prevent two processes
from refreshing the same account tokens. Do not put callback URLs, API keys or
OAuth tokens in logs or shell history. State files are credentials, not history;
this installation deliberately uses reauthentication instead of token backups.
